# Python Flask Web App Design Assistant

**Problem Analysis**
- **Problem:** Design a simple Python Flask application that allows users to input their name and receive a personalized greeting.

**Flask Application Design**

**HTML Files**

- **index.html:**
 - Displays a form to collect the user's name.
 - Includes necessary HTML elements like `<input type="text">` for name input and a `<button>` to submit the form.

- **greeting.html:**
 - Displays a personalized greeting message based on the user's input.
 - Includes HTML elements like `<h1>` for the greeting message.

**Routes**

- **@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**
 - This route handles requests made to the root URL of the application.
 - It serves the `index.html` file when accessed using the GET method (for displaying the form).
 - It processes the submitted form data when accessed using the POST method and redirects to the `/greeting` route.

- **@app.route('/greeting', methods=['GET'])**
 - This route handles requests made to the `/greeting` URL.
 - It extracts the user's name from the form data and generates a personalized greeting message.
 - It renders the `greeting.html` file, passing the greeting message as a variable.
